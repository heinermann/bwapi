## SNP_DirectIP

This is a SNP (I'm assuming Storm Network Protocol/Provider?) developed for Starcraft to enable DirectIP and LocalPC network modes.

### DirectIP
Allows you to connect directly to a given IP address.

### LocalPC
Allows you to connect to other game instances on the same machine.
